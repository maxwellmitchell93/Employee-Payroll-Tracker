# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description 
-My motivation for creating this project was to create an easy and simple way for companies to input and keep track of employee salaries. 
-I built this project to learn more about javascript programing language. 
-This web application will help companies with their payroll proccess and keep track of employee salary data.

## Installation

## Usage
-When the user opens the web app they will see an Employee Roster with sections called "First Name", "Last Name", & "Salary". 

-Above these sections there will be an inputbox that asks the user to "Enter employees first name","Enter employees last name", & "Enter employees salary". 

-Underneathe are two buttons named "Canel" & "OK". After the user inputs the employee data they are then asked if they would like to add another employee by typing in "yes" or "no" then clicking "OK". 

-When the user is finished inputing all the desired employee data, a list of the employees will diplay in the Eployee Roster in alphebetical order. When opening the console, the employee arrays are displayed, along with the averege salary of the employees & a random drawing winner
